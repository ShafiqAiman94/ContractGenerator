# ContractGenerator

Deploying smart contract to the blockchain is quite annoyed for me. So, I created a bash script for generate a javascript files from solidity source code. But I didnt put selection for the account, only uses acoount[0] and gass cost is 10000 wei. You need to configure it manually.
